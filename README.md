# Foundry AI

This is a trial to see how much of the [Foundry
VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) API can be controlled by a remove server
over a Websocket. The goal is to create an FRP-oriented protocol
suitable for fully instrumenting a 2D VTT, but particularly
specialized for Foundry. The intent is to use a Websocket, but support
for polling via HTTP is considered.
